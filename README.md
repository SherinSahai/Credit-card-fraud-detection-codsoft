**Credit Card Fraud Detection**
**Project Overview**
This project aims to detect credit card fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms. Fraudulent transactions result in significant financial losses for individuals and institutions. This project utilizes Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest algorithms to identify high-risk transactions.

**Methodology**

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating additional relevant features (e.g., transaction frequency, amount variance).
3. Model Selection: Comparing performance of Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest algorithms.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters using cross-validation.

**Models
